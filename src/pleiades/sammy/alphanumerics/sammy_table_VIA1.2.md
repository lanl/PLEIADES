Although this is the default format for input of quantum-number information, it is not the preferred method because the input is awkward for many situations (e.g., charged-particle channels).

(See card set 2 Table VI A.1 for input for NEPNTS.) Warning: SAMMY merely counts; it does not consider carefully whether a dividing point is located in a region where the theoretical values (σ or T) are nonlinear with respect to the parameters. Dividing in such a location (at or near a resonance) will invalidate the linearity assumption used in deriving Bayes' equation, and thus lead to spurious results. Users are urged to use this option only on the "zeroth pass," as an aid in deciding where to divide the data, and not for final runs. With high-capacity computer systems available today, this option is seldom needed. | 24  |
