Installation Guide
==================

This section provides detailed steps to install both SAMMY and the PLEIADES Python package.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

* **git**: A version control system used to clone repositories. You can install it using your system's package manager (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `brew`, etc.).
* **pip**: A package installer for Python. It is included with Python installations, or you can install it via your systemâ€™s package manager.

Step-by-Step Installation
--------------------------

1. **Clone and Build SAMMY**

   First, you need to clone and install SAMMY. Follow the steps below:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://code.ornl.gov/RNSD/SAMMY.git

   Next, navigate to the SAMMY directory and build the package:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd SAMMY/sammy
      mkdir myscript
      cp script/configure_sammy_gcc.sh myscript/
      mkdir build
      cd build
      ../myscript/configure_sammy_gcc.sh ../
      make -j4
      make install

2. **Verify SAMMY Installation (Optional)**

   To ensure that SAMMY has been installed correctly, open a new terminal and check if SAMMY is accessible by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sammy

   If successful, the SAMMY command should execute without errors.

3. **Clone the PLEIADES Repository**

   After installing SAMMY, you can clone the PLEIADES repository from GitHub:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/lanl/PLEIADES

4. **Install the PLEIADES Package**

   Navigate to the cloned `Pleiades` repository and install the package using `pip`:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd Pleiades
      pip install -e .

6. **Uninstalling PLEIADES (Optional)**

   If you ever need to uninstall the PLEIADES package, you can do so using `pip`:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip uninstall pleiades

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you encounter issues during the installation of SAMMY or PLEIADES, refer to the following resources:

* **SAMMY Documentation**: Visit the `SAMMY website <https://code.ornl.gov/RNSD/SAMMY>`_ for installation and configuration guidance.
