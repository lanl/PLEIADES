The PARameter file contains initial values for all those parameters that are to be varied, as well as others that may be held fixed or treated as propagated-uncertainty parameters

Various types of data can be included in the PARameter file. These are organized into “cardsets,” with each card set consisting of one or more lines of information. Most card sets begin with a header line and end with a blank line.

"Card set 1" contains resonance parameters, ending in a blank line.
"Card set 2" contains a single number, called FUDGE, which is the “fudge factor” by which a parameter may multiplied to give the initial uncertainty for that parameter. This option is used only if the parameter’s uncertainty is not specified elsewhere.
"Card set 3" gives values for parameters of the external R-function. Two alternate formats are available for this.
"Card set 4" gives values for some broadening (and other) parameters.
"Card set 5" gives values of “unused” parameters, that is, of those data-reduction parameters that are not directly affected by the data set to be analyzed but that are coupled via the covariance matrix to other parameters that are directly affected.
"Card set 6" gives values for normalization and background parameters.
"Card set 7" contains values for the two channel radii (as used for potential scattering and for penetrability and shift factor).
"Card set 8" gives names and values for data reduction parameters
"Card set 9" gives values of parameters for the Oak Ridge resolution function (ORR)
"Card set 10" contains isotopic mass and abundance values, as described in Section III.E.2 of the SAMMY manual.
"Card set 11" contains values for miscellaneous parameters, described in various locations
throughout the SAMMY manual.
"Card set 12" provides parameter values for paramagnetic cross sections; see Section III.E.4 of the SAMMY manual.
"Card set 13" contains values for parameters of the background functions described in Section III.E.3.a of the SAMMY manual.
"Card set 14" gives parameters of the RPI resolution function (Section III.C.3).
"Card set 15" provides values for l- and isotope-dependent detector efficiencies (Section III.E.5).
"Card set 16" gives input for the numerical user-defined resolution function. This is described in more detail in Section III.C.5.

Note that each card set in the PAR file (except for card sets 1 and 2) begins with an alphanumeric description of what follows.

For including Quantum numbers in PARameter file please see Table VI B.3. in the SAMMY manual.
Which follows as the following lines:

[1st line] PARTIcle pair definitions (first five characters required)
[following lines] Card set 4 from the INPut file (Table VI.A.1),
[blank line]
[following line] SPIN GROUPs (first ten characters required)
[following lines] Card set 10.2 from INPut file
[blank line]
[following line] RESONances are listed next (first five characters required)
The remainder of the file is identical to original PARameter file (starting with card set 1)

Here are the formats for each card:
Note:   The two numbers in the first column (labeled “C:L”) represent the card set number (before the colon) and the line number within that card set (after the colon).
Note:   Numbers in the second column (labeled “P, T”) indicate position number within the line. Letters indicate format type: integer format (“I”, which implies a number without a decimal point and requires that the number be in the right-most columns), real format (“F”, which requires a number with a decimal point), or alphanumeric (“A”, which can be numbers or letters or symbols).
