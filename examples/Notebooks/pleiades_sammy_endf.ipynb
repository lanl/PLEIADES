    "### PLEIADES Tutorial - SAMMY Exercise EX027: Generating Parameter Files Based on ENDF Files\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise demonstrates how to use SAMMY to generate parameter files starting from ENDF files. The goal is to familiarize analysts with the process of running SAMMY directly from ENDF data and modifying the output for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose\n",
    "The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to:\n",
    "1. Run SAMMY using ENDF files as input.\n",
    "2. Generate SAMMY-style INPut and PARameter files for subsequent runs.\n",
    "3. Modify and refine the generated files to fit experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "SAMMY can read File 2 of an ENDF file and perform a run as specified in the INPut file. The output includes SAMMY-style INPut and PARameter files, which can be used for further analysis. However, since ENDF files lack some information required by SAMMY, only simple no-Bayes runs can be performed directly from ENDF files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions\n",
    "1. **Initial Run**:\n",
    "    - Use the command file `ex027a` to set up a no-Bayes run starting from the ENDF file.\n",
    "    - The INPut file `ex027a.inp` does not include spin group information, which will be extracted from the ENDF file.\n",
    "    - The experimental data file `ex027a.dat` assumes a 10% uncertainty due to the lack of provided uncertainties in the original data.\n",
    "    - Run this setup to generate SAMMY-style INPut and PARameter files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Refining the Output**:\n",
    "    - Modify the generated INPut and PARameter files for further analysis:\n",
    "      - Update the thickness to `0.002800 atoms/barn`.\n",
    "      - Enable single-scattering corrections and normalize as cross sections.\n",
    "    - For Bayesian analysis, flag at least one parameter in the PARameter file.\n",
    "    - Adjust the uncertainty settings in the INPut file by setting the `VMIN` parameter in Card Set 7 to account for unrealistic weights on background points.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fitting the Data**:\n",
    "    - Start with small energy ranges for better fits, as the data set contains many points and gaps.\n",
    "    - Normalize the data appropriately. For example, in the energy range from 6 to 100 eV, a normalization factor of nearly 10 is required.\n",
    "    - Experiment with fitting strategies to improve the fit quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise provides a hands-on approach to understanding the workflow of using SAMMY with ENDF files and refining the results for meaningful analysis.\n"

    "### PRE-SETUP: Initializing Directories and Files for the Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we need to set up a temporary directory and link all the required SAMMY files to it. This ensures that the necessary files are organized and accessible for running the SAMMY exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we will create symbolic links for the required files from the `ex027` example into the designated `working_dir`. These files are essential for configuring and executing the SAMMY run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The directories are configured as follows:\n",
    "- **Working Directory**: `/tmp/sammy_run`\n",
    "- **Output Directory**: `/tmp/sammy_run/sammy_output`\n",
    "\n",
    "The following files should be available in the `working_dir`:\n",
    "- `ex027a.inp`: Input file defining the initial setup for the SAMMY run.\n",
    "- `ex027a.par`: Parameter file generated from the ENDF data.\n",
    "- `ex027a.dat`: Data file with experimental data assuming a 10% uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that these files are correctly linked to the `working_dir` before proceeding with the analysis."
