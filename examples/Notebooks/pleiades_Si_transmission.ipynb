    "## PLEIADES Tutorial - SAMMY Exercise EX012: Treating Multiple Nuclides in a Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to SAMMY Exercise EX012 from the PLEIADES examples. The exercise demonstrates how to handle samples containing multiple nuclides, a scenario frequently encountered in real-world experiments. By leveraging PLEIADES, users will learn to configure, execute, and analyze SAMMY runs for such complex cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how to use PLEIADES to manage SAMMY runs for samples with multiple nuclides.\n",
    "- Learn to define spin groups, resonance parameters, and nuclide abundances.\n",
    "- Explore the impact of individual isotopes or spin groups on the overall sample.\n",
    "- Refine resonance parameters and nuclide abundances to improve the fit to experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Details\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using PLEIADES**:\n",
    "    - This notebook demonstrates the step-by-step process of setting up and executing SAMMY runs using PLEIADES.\n",
    "    - It includes configuring the environment, linking necessary files, running SAMMY, and analyzing the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Multiple Nuclides**:\n",
    "    - The exercise focuses on treating samples with multiple isotopes or contaminants.\n",
    "    - Users will learn to exclude specific spin groups and analyze their contributions to the overall sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Practical Insights**:\n",
    "    - Gain insights into how resonance parameters and spin groups influence experimental results.\n",
    "    - Experiment with different configurations to understand the behavior of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the steps in this notebook to configure the SAMMY environment, link the required files, and execute the SAMMY runs. Analyze the results to refine nuclide abundances and resonance parameters. Experiment with excluding specific spin groups to observe their individual contributions and deepen your understanding of treating multiple nuclides in a sample."

    "To begin, we need to set up a temporary directory and link all the required SAMMY files to it. This ensures that the necessary files are organized and accessible for running the SAMMY exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we will create symbolic links for the required files from the `ex012` example into the designated `working_dir`. These files are essential for configuring and executing the SAMMY run.\n",
