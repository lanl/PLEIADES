PLEIADES' user documentation
============================

**PLEIADES:**
Python Libraries Extensions for Isotopic Analysis via Detailed Examination of SAMMY.
This is a Python package that sets up, executes, and analyzes, SAMMY runs.
If you are unfamiliar with SAMMY, please see the `SAMMY website <https://code.ornl.gov/RNSD/SAMMY>`_.

The user documentation can be found at `Read the Docs <https://pleiades-sammy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Installation
============

**For Users:**

Install from PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pleiades-neutron

Or from conda-forge:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge pleiades-neutron

**For Developers:**

**Prerequisites:**

* ``git``: A version control system used to clone the SAMMY repository. You can usually install it using your system's package manager.
* ``pixi``: A package installer for Python that manages environments and dependencies. You can install it following the instructions at `Pixi Installation <https://pixi.sh/latest/>`_.

**Steps:**

1. **Clone and build the SAMMY Repository:**

   Use ``git`` to clone the SAMMY repository from GitLab:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://code.ornl.gov/RNSD/SAMMY.git


2. **Build and Install SAMMY:**

   Navigate to the cloned SAMMY directory (``SAMMY/sammy``) and follow the SAMMY installation instructions to build and install it. Refer to the SAMMY documentation for specific instructions.


   .. code-block:: bash

      cd SAMMY/sammy
      mkdir myscript
      cp script/configure_sammy_gcc.sh myscript/
      mkdir build
      cd build
      ../myscript/configure_sammy_gcc.sh ../
      make -j4
      make install

3. **Verification (Optional):**

   Open a new terminal window and check if the SAMMY executables are accessible. You can try running a SAMMY command, such as ``sammy``. If successful, the command should execute.

4. **Clone the PLEIADES Repository:**

   Use ``git`` to clone the PLEIADES repository from GitHub:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/lanl/PLEIADES.git

5. **Navigate to the Directory:**

   Change directories to the cloned PLEIADES repository:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd PLEIADES

6. **Install Using Pixi:**

   Use ``pixi`` to create and activate the development environment:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pixi install

   This will install all required dependencies in an isolated environment and activate it.

   You can run the post-installation check after SAMMY is installed:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pixi run post_install_check

   Pixi manages all dependencies and environments for you, making it easy to work with PLEIADES alongside other Python projects.

7. **Add SAMMY's bin Directory to PATH:**

   You'll need to add the ``bin`` directory of the installed SAMMY package to your system's PATH environment variable.
   This allows ``pleiades`` to locate the necessary SAMMY executables.

   - Open your terminal and edit your shell configuration file (e.g., ``.bashrc`` for Bash).
   - Add the following line (replace ``<SAMMY_INSTALL_DIR>`` with the actual installation directory of SAMMY):

     .. code-block:: bash

        export PATH=$PATH:<SAMMY_INSTALL_DIR>/bin

   - Save the changes and source the configuration file to apply the changes immediately:

     .. code-block:: bash

        source ~/.bashrc  # Replace with your shell configuration file name

8. **Development Tasks (Optional):**

   PLEIADES provides several convenient development tasks through Pixi:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # Run tests
      pixi run test

      # Build documentation
      pixi run build-docs

      # Format code
      pixi run format

      # Run linting checks
      pixi run lint

      # Install pre-commit hooks
      pixi run pre-commit-install


**Troubleshooting:**

   * If you encounter issues during the SAMMY installation or path configuration, refer to the SAMMY documentation for specific guidance.
   * For Pixi-related issues, check the `Pixi documentation <https://pixi.sh/latest/>`_.

**Additional Notes:**

* Two environments available: ``default`` (development) and ``jupyter`` (notebook work). Use ``pixi shell -e jupyter`` to activate jupyter environment.
* See available tasks: ``pixi task list``
