Run time notes:
Need to use the lowest mass in a compound nuclei fit otherwise you get this:
 ***************************************************************************
 * Warning -- Mass used to determine limits for auxiliary grid (for Dopplr *
 * and multiple-scattering corrections) may be too big. SAMMY is using the *
 * mass from nuclide number 2 (238.050770), because that is closest to the *
 * mass from Line 2 of the INPut file (238.050800).  For more accurate     *
 * results, use the mass of the smallest nuclide (235.043940).  (Expect    *
 * longer runtime if you change to the smaller mass.)                      *
