 Card Set 2 – General Experimental Setup Parameters

    Purpose:
        Specifies core settings related to the experimental sample and numerical controls.
        Includes the sample's element name, energy range, atomic weight, and tuning
        parameters for grid generation, iteration limits, and covariance handling.

    Structure:

        Line 1 (Only Line in Card Set 2)
            Columns | Type | Name     | Description
            --------|------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------
            1–10    | A    | ELMNT    | Name of the sample element (e.g., U235, Cd, etc.)
            11–20   | F    | AW       | Atomic weight of the sample isotope (amu)

    Notes:
        - EMIN/EMAX are ignored if energy range is provided interactively or from ENDF
        - ITMAX can be set negative to allow more than 9 iterations (see manual)
        - ICORR is used only when printing is requested for small correlations
        - NXTRA and IPTDOP affect interpolation accuracy for Doppler broadening
        - IXXCHN is rarely used; useful only for skipping channels in ODF files or specifying ENDF ZA
        - NDIGIT controls output format of covariance in SAMMY.CCV
        - IDROPP only applies if “DROP SMALL VALUES OF correlation matrix” appears in Card Set 3

 Card Set 3 – Alphanumeric Command Statements

    Purpose:
        Card Set 3 specifies SAMMY control behavior using plain English alphanumeric
        commands. These statements activate specific models, options, and processing modes,
        including formalism selection, data handling, broadening choices, print settings, etc.

        This is the core instruction set for customizing a SAMMY run.

    Structure:

        Line 1, 2, ... N
            Each line contains one or more commands (typically one per line)
            Commands must be in columns 1–20 (free format)
            Case insensitive, first 20 characters are significant
            Comments:
                - Use "#" in column 1 to comment out a line
                - Use a full line of hyphens ("--------------------") to start/end a block comment

    Example Commands:
        REICH-MOORE FORMALISm is wanted
        USE FREE GAS MODEL OF doppler broadening
        SOLVE BAYES EQUATIONs
        BROADENING IS WANTED
        DATA ARE IN ORIGINAL multi-style format
        DROP SMALL VALUES OF correlation matrix
        PLOT RESOLUTION FUNCTION
        KEY-WORD PARTICLE-PAIR definitions are given

    Categories (see full tables in manual for command lists):
        - R-matrix Formalism: REICH-MOORE, MLBW, SLBW, etc.
        - Data Input: formats for experiment and covariances
        - Broadening: resolution and Doppler function flags
        - Multiple-Scattering: inclusion of shielding and corrections
        - Quantum Numbers: formats and overrides for spin group/channel inputs
        - Output Control: LPT file print options, compact covariance, etc.
        - ENDF Output: file types, flags, MAT values
        - Fitting Procedure: solve Bayes, inversion schemes, PUP generation

    End of Card 3:
        - Followed by next card set (usually card set 4 or 4a)
        - No specific terminator is required

    Notes:
        - Commands are parsed in order; last occurrence overrides previous ones
        - Each command typically begins in column 1 and ends by column 20
        - SAMMY prints all unrecognized commands as warnings and ignores them
        - Some commands affect which later card sets must or must not be present
        - See Table VI A1.2 (manual) for a full list of supported commands

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 Card Set 4 – Particle Pair Definitions (Keyword Format)

    Purpose:
        Provides definitions of particle pairs involved in the reaction channels.
        This format uses keywords for specifying properties of particles A and B.
        It supports isotopic details, spins, charges, Q-values, and channel radii.

        This is the preferred format over Card Set 4a due to flexibility and clarity.

    Structure:

        Line 1 (Header – Required)
            Trigger: Must be preceded by the command:
                     “KEY-WORD PARTICLE PAir definitions are given” (in Card Set 3)

        Lines 2, 3, ..., N: Definitions for each particle pair using keyword=value format
            Keywords (capital letters required):
                - NAME = Unique 8-character name for the particle pair
                - Particle A or PA = Name of incident particle
                - Particle B or PB = Name of target particle
                - Mass A or MA = Mass of particle A (amu)
                - Mass B or MB = Mass of particle B (amu)
                - Charge A or ZA = Charge of particle A (in e)
                - Charge B or ZB = Charge of particle B
                - Spin A or SA = Spin (±parity) of particle A
                - Spin B or SB = Spin (±parity) of particle B
                - PARIty A = Needed only if Spin A = 0 and parity is negative
                - PARIty B = Same for B
                - PEnetrability = Yes or No (1 or 0)
                - Shift = Yes or No (1 or 0)
                - Q-value or THreshold = Reaction Q-value (in eV)
                - EFfective radius or RE = Channel effective radius (fermi)
                - TRue radius or RT = True channel radius (fermi)

        Repeat:
            Repeat blocks for each particle pair.
            Use another NAME=... to start a new pair definition.
            End card set with a blank line.

    Notes:
        - Keywords are case-insensitive; spacing is flexible.
        - SAMMY supports shorthand for particle types:
            NEUtron / N
            PROton / P
            DEUteron / D
            ALPha / A
            HE3 / H
            TRIton / T
        - Mass, spin, and charge defaults will be applied if particle type is known.
        - Channel radii here are “default” values and can be overridden by Card Set 7 or 7a in the PARameter file.

    Example:
        NAME = nPb208
        PA = N    PB = Pb208
        MA = 1.008665   ZA = 0   SA = 0.5
        MB = 207.9766   ZB = 82  SB = 0
        PENETRABILITY = YES
        SHIFT = YES
        Q-VALUE = 0.0
        RE = 5.0
        RT = 5.0

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 Card Set 4a – Particle Pair Definitions (Fixed Format)

    Purpose:
        Defines particle-pair information using a fixed-column format. This includes
        particle types, charges, spins, masses, and threshold energies. It is functionally
        equivalent to Card Set 4 but uses a legacy column-based input format.

        This card set is used when the command:
            "PARTICLE-PAIR DEFINItions are used"
        appears in Card Set 3.

    Structure:

        Line 1, 2, 3, ..., N: One line per particle pair
            Columns | Type | Name     | Description
            --------|------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------
            1–8     | A    | NAMPP    | Name of the particle pair (used in other card sets)
            9–10    | A    | Aa       | Type of particle A (incident, e.g., 'n', 'p', 'de', etc.)
            11–12   | A    | Ab       | Type of particle B (target)
            13–15   | I    | Za       | Charge of particle A
            16–18   | I    | Zb       | Charge of particle B
            19      | I    | Lpent    | 1 = calculate penetrability, 0 = assume P = 1
            20      | I    | Ishift   | 1 = calculate shift factor, 0 = assume S - B = 0
            21–25   | F    | Sa       | Spin (+ parity) of particle A
            26–30   | F    | Sb       | Spin (+ parity) of particle B
            31–40   | F    | Ma       | Mass of particle A (amu)
            41–50   | F    | Mb       | Mass of particle B (amu)
            51–60   | F    | Ex       | Excitation energy (threshold) (eV)
            61–70   | F    | Re       | Effective radius for this particle pair (fermi)
            71–80   | F    | Rt       | True channel radius (fermi)

        Repeat:
            Repeat line for each particle pair.
            End card set with a blank line.

    Notes:
        - Special particle abbreviations like "n", "p", "de", "al" auto-fill mass, spin, etc.
        - Channel radii (Re, Rt) can be overwritten in the PARameter file
        - This fixed format is deprecated in favor of the keyword format in Card 4, but is still supported

    Example:
        nU235   n  U  0 92  1 1 0.5 3.5 1.0087 235.0439 0.0  5.0 5.0

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 Card Set 5 – Doppler and Resolution Broadening Parameters

    Purpose:
        Specifies values used in modeling Doppler and resolution broadening.
        These parameters are used unless overridden by the PARameter file.

        Required only if “BROADENING IS WANTED” is specified in Card Set 3.
        SAMMY will abort if this card set is omitted when broadening is requested.

    Structure:

        Line 1 (Only Line in Card Set 5)
            Columns | Type | Name     | Description
            --------|------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------
            1–10    | F    | TEMP     | Effective sample temperature (K)
            11–20   | F    | DIST     | Flight-path length (m)
            21–30   | F    | DELTAL   | Portion of Gaussian resolution width from flight path (m)
            31–40   | F    | DELTAE   | E-folding width of exponential resolution function (s)
            41–50   | F    | DELTAG   | FWHM of Gaussian resolution from burst width (s)
            51–60   | F    | DELTTT   | Step size for Leal-Hwang Doppler method (K)
            61–70   | F    | ELOWBR   | Energy below which no broadening is applied (eV)
            71–80   | F    | DDDEEE   | Range for straight-line energy-average resolution (eV)

    Notes:
        - TEMP = 0 disables Doppler broadening
        - DELTAG = 0 disables Gaussian burst broadening
        - DELTAE = 0 disables exponential tail broadening
        - DELTTT > 0 is required for Leal-Hwang Doppler method; default is 5.0
        - ELOWBR sets a cutoff for Doppler broadening
        - DDDEEE used for simplified energy-averaging resolution model
        - These values may be overridden by PAR file Card Set 4 (see Table VI B.2)
        - Do not include this card if using Card 14, 14a, or 16 exclusively

    Example:
        300.0     12.5     0.0500   0.0000   0.0005   5.0    0.0     0.0

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 Card Set 6 – Channel Widths for Crunch Regions

    Purpose:
        Specifies how the auxiliary energy grid is refined across narrow resonances
        using energy-dependent “crunch” factors. Only required if DELTAG < 0
        in Card Set 5, which signals use of this format.

        This card lets you define a piecewise grid width used for resolution
        calculations, offering finer control across different energy regions.

    Structure:

        Line 1 (Crunch Settings Header)
            6:1
            Columns | Type | Name     | Description
            --------|------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------
            1–10    | F    | DELTAB   | Minimum channel width (s) from EMIN to EMAX
            11–15   | I    | NCF      | Number of crunch intervals (energy subregions)

        Line 2 (First Crunch Interval)
            6:2
            Columns | Type | Name     | Description
            --------|------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------
            1–10    | F    | BCF(1)   | Upper energy limit of first interval (eV)
            11–15   | I    | CF(1)    | Crunch factor for this region (applies to DELTAB)

        Lines 3, 4, ..., N
            6:3,4,...
            Columns | Type | Name     | Description
            --------|------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------
            1–10    | F    | BCF(i)   | Upper energy boundary for interval i (increasing)
            11–15   | I    | CF(i)    | Crunch factor for interval i (integer multiple of DELTAB)

            Notes:
            - DELTAB × CF(i) gives the actual channel width used in region i
            - BCF(i−1) < E < BCF(i) defines each energy subrange

        End of Card 6:
            - After N = NCF lines have been given for the intervals, insert a blank line

    Notes:
        - Used only when Gaussian resolution broadening is active and DELTAG < 0
        - Allows very fine grid control near resonances
        - Grid refinement across energy ranges enables accurate convolution
        - Not needed for standard constant resolution widths

    Example:
        Line 1: 0.000001  3
        Line 2:  10.0     10
        Line 3: 100.0     5
        Line 4:1000.0     1

        → Crunch width = 10 × DELTAB for E < 10 eV,
                         5 × DELTAB for 10–100 eV,
                         1 × DELTAB for 100–1000 eV

 Card Set 7 – Matching Radius, Sample Thickness, and Covariance Parameters

    Purpose:
        Specifies physical and statistical modeling parameters related to the experimental setup.
        This includes the R-matrix channel radius, sample thickness, and terms used in defining
        experimental data covariance.

        These parameters may be overridden by PAR file entries (Card Set 4 or 7 of PAR).

    Structure:

        Line 1 (Only Line in Card Set 7)
            7:1
            Columns | Type | Name     | Description
            --------|------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------
            1–10    | F    | CRFN     | Channel (matching) radius (fermi)
            11–20   | F    | THICK    | Sample thickness (atoms/barn)
            21–30   | F    | DCOVA    | Constant term in data covariance (default = 0.0)
            31–40   | F    | DCOVB    | Linear term in data covariance (default = 0.0)
            41–50   | F    | VMIN     | Minimum absolute uncertainty on experimental data

    Notes:
        - If CRFN = 0, SAMMY calculates: CRFN = 1.45 × (1.008665 + AW)^(1/3)
        - THICK is required only for transmission, total cross section, or when
          multiple scattering/self-shielding is enabled
        - DCOVA and DCOVB define a contribution to data covariance:
              (DCOVA + Ei × DCOVB) × (DCOVA + Ej × DCOVB)
        - VMIN sets a floor for uncertainty. If a DATa file value < VMIN,
          SAMMY increases it to match

    Example:
        5.2000    0.0020   0.0050     0.0005     0.0001

 Card Set 9 – Obsolete Target Spin/Parity Specification (Ignored)
\
    Purpose:
        Historically used to specify the spin and parity of the target nucleus.
        This card set is now obsolete and should not be used in new INPut files.

        It is preserved here for completeness and historical documentation only.

    Structure:

        Line 1 (Ignored)
            9:1
            Contents of this line (if present) are ignored by SAMMY.

    Notes:
        - This card was used in early versions of SAMMY to provide quantum number input
        - For SAMMY version M6 and newer:
            → Spin/parity information should be defined in:
                - Card Set 10.1 (new spin group format)
                - or Card Set 10.2 + Card Set 4 or 4a (preferred method)
        - SAMMY will currently ignore Card Set 9 without error
        - Future versions may require its complete removal from INPut files
        - If present, this line has no effect on results

    Recommendation:
        - Do not use Card Set 9
        - Use Card Set 4 or 4a and Card Set 10.2 to define spin/parity info for target nuclide

    Example (ignored):
        0.5 +

 Card Set 10.1 – Spin Group and Channel Definitions (New Format, Default)

    Purpose:
        Defines spin groups and associated channels using a structured, column-based format.
        This format supersedes the original Card Set 10 and is now the default.
        It allows specification of spin/parity, abundance, entrance/exit channels, and
        channel-level quantum numbers and radii.

        Preferred for evaluations without complex charged-particle structure.
        For charged-particle flexibility, use Card Set 10.2 + Card Set 4 or 4a.

    Structure:

        Line 1 – Spin Group Definition
            10.1:1
            Columns | Type | Name       | Description

            11–15   | I    | NEXT       | Number of non-entrance exit channels (can be 0)
            16–20   | F    | SPINJ      | Resonance spin J (± for parity)
            21–30   | F    | ABNDNC     | Isotopic abundance for this spin group
            31–35   | F    | SPINI      | Target nuclide spin (± for parity)

            --------|------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------
            4–5     | I    | N           | Channel number
            6–8     | I    | KZ1         | Charge of particle 1 (e.g., projectile)
            10      | I    | LPENT       | 1 = calc. penetrability, 0 = P = 1
            11–13   | I    | KZ2         | Charge of particle 2 (target)
            15      | I    | ISHIFT      | 1 = calc. shift, 0 = S - B = 0

            19–20   | I    | LSPIN       | Orbital angular momentum ℓ
            21–30   | F    | CHSPIN      | Channel spin (± parity)
            31–40   | F    | ENBND       | Boundary condition (eV)
            41–50   | F    | ECHAN       | Excitation energy of residual (eV)
            51–55   | F    | RDEFF       | Effective radius (fermi)
            56–60   | F    | RDTRU       | True radius (fermi)
            61–70   | F    | EMM1        | Mass of first particle (amu)
            71–80   | F    | EMM2        | Mass of second particle (amu)

        Repeat Line 2 for NENT + NEXT times for each spin group

        Repeat Lines 1 and 2+ for each spin group (JJ)

    Notes:
        - This is the default spin group format in SAMMY 8+
        - Use EXCL = 'X' to deactivate spin group from cross section
        - Boundary condition ENBND < 0 means B = ENBND directly
        - Radius values may be overridden by the PARameter file
        - Mass = 0 triggers auto-assignment using AW (from Card 2) or default neutron mass
        - SPINI applies to all spin groups and matches target nuclide definition

    Example:
        1   2 1   0.5  0.9  0.5
            1 0 1 92 1 0 0 0.5 -1.0 0.0 0.0 238.0 1.0087

 Card Set 10.2 – Spin Group Definitions Using Particle-Pair Names

    Purpose:
        Defines spin groups and channels using particle-pair names from Card Set 4 or 4a.
        This is the preferred modern format for flexible specification of quantum numbers,
        especially for charged-particle channels.

        Must be used with Card Set 4 or 4a and the command:
            “KEY-WORD PARTICLE-PAir definitions are given” (in Card Set 3)

    Structure:

        Line 1 – Spin Group Definition
            10.2:1
            Columns | Type | Name      | Description
            --------|------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------

            21–30   | F    | ABNDNC    | Isotopic abundance for spin group

        Line 2+ – Channel Definitions (NENT + NEXT lines per spin group)

            51–60   | F    | RDTRU     | True radius (fermi)

        Repeat Line 2 for NENT + NEXT channels, then repeat Lines 1–2 for each spin group.

    Notes:
        - Must be paired with Card Set 4 or 4a for particle pair definitions
        - Particle-pair names must match exactly those declared in Card Set 4/4a
        - RDEFF/RDTRU override values from Card Set 4/4a unless PAR file entries are used
        - ENBND < 0: B = ENBND (constant)
          ENBND > 0: B = Sl(ka) evaluated at ENBND
        - This format is highly recommended over Card Set 10.1

    Example:
        1   2 1   0.5  0.9
          1  nU235       0 0 0.5 -1.0  0.0  5.0 5.0

Card Set 11 – Multiple-Scattering and Self-Shielding Parameters

    Purpose:
        Specifies geometry and integration parameters for self-shielding and
        multiple-scattering corrections. Required only when such corrections
        are enabled using a command in Card Set 3.

    Structure:

    Notes:
        - THSAMP = thickness in cm (convert from atoms/barn using material density)
        - XBEAM, XSAMP: height or radius depending on geometry
        - θ and z integrations are used in computing multiple-scattering and
          self-shielding corrections with Gaussian quadrature
        - XTMIN/XTMAX control range of log(σ_t) used in interpolation of Q
        - This card must be omitted if corrections are not requested (SAMMY will abort)

 Remaining card sets in the INPut file


    Notes:
        These are all exact duplicates of corresponding card sets in the PARameter file.
        Any given card set can appear in either the INPut file or the PARameter file,
        but not both. If the same card set is found in both locations, SAMMY will abort.

        These remaining INPut card sets allow users to specify experimental-setup-dependent
        parameters locally (rather than globally through the PARameter file), which is
        useful when performing evaluations across multiple experiments using the same
        resonance structure but different sample conditions.

        Flags:
            - A variation flag of 1 is ignored when the card set appears in the INPut file
            - A variation flag of 3 is allowed and treated as a Propagated Uncertainty Parameter (PUP)

    Remaining INPut Card Sets:

        P4    – BROADening parameters
        P6    – NORMAlization and background
        P8    – DATA reduction parameters
        P9    – ORRES (Oak Ridge Resolution Function)
        P10   – ISOTOpic or NUCLIde abundances
        P11   – MISCEllaneous parameters
        P12   – PARAMagnetic cross section parameters
        P13   – BACKGround functions
        P14   – RPI, GEEL, GELINa, or NTOF resolution function
        P14a  – RPI (T/C) or GELINa/GEEL defaults (keyword format)
        P15   – DETECtor efficiencies
        P16   – USER-Defined resolution function

    Additional Notes:
        - If Card Set 11 is omitted from the INPut file, two blank lines must precede the P-card sets
        - The ordering of the P-card sets is flexible but must follow all numbered card sets
        - These card sets share the same format and logic as defined in the PAR file documentation

 Additional run time notes

    If performing a multi-isotope fit, then the lowest mass of the compound nuclei fit
    needs to be used in Line 2 of Card Set 2 (i.e., the AW field), otherwise you get
    the following error message.

    ***************************************************************************
    * Warning -- Mass used to determine limits for auxiliary grid (for Dopplr *
    * and multiple-scattering corrections) may be too big. SAMMY is using the *
    * mass from nuclide number 2 (238.050770), because that is closest to the *
    * mass from Line 2 of the INPut file (238.050800).  For more accurate     *
    * results, use the mass of the smallest nuclide (235.043940).  (Expect    *
    * longer runtime if you change to the smaller mass.)                      *
